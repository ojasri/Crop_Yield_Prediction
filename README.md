Crop Yield Prediction 
Using KNN Regressor 
  _ 
Overview: 
This project aims to predict crop yields using machine learning techniques. The implementation 
includes data analysis, model training, and a predictive system for estimating crop yields based 
on various factors such as climate, pesticides used, and crop type. 
Features: 
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset 
 Visualization of relationships between crop yield and environmental factors 
 Data preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables 
 Training and evaluation of regression models including Linear Regression, K-Nearest 
Neighbors, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, and Decision Tree Regression 
 Selection of the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics 
 Creation of a predictive system for estimating crop yields 
 Saving the trained model and preprocessing steps for future use 
 SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis for model interpretation 
Requirements: 
 Python 3.x 
 NumPy 
 pandas 
 seaborn 
 matplotlib 
 scikit-learn 
 plotly 
 SHAP
